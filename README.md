Step #1 Install Metamask
------------------------
We have our own browser plugin tool in development called AIM or AVIV Identity Manager, however this is as yet unreleased and thus for the purposes of development we recommend you use Metamask.
You can install [Metamask from Google Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) and it will work fine for Chrome, Chromium, Vivaldi and Brave browsers, probably others as well.  At the moment we have only tested it on Chromium and Brave.

Once it has been installed, open it up and go through the configuration steps and once this is done, please ensure you set the network to **Rinkeby Test Network**.

Step #2 Acquire Testnet ETH for Rinkeby
------------------------

After installing and configuring metamask, you will need to acquire some Rinkeby Testnet Ethers.  There are a couple of very good ones but we officially recommend the official faucet at https://faucet.rinkeby.io
Follow the instructions exactly to ensure you get the maximum amount of Ether which is presently 18.75 Ethers / 3 day as shown below.

Step #3 Add deployed tokens to Metamask
------------------------
All of our tokens are deployed on Rinkeby

Estates are deployed at 0x39cac5c49fbc5ab963bbad547e605ff7fed2ee1e

TRs are deployed at 0x0a97190ea26f7e87566a972f8f0f6632274eb1b2

Instructions for adding the tokens to [metamask are here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-Adding-and-Managing-Tokens-ERC20-In-The-New-UI)
Note that Metamask has no idea about our tokens yet because we're still in development.  Therefore you need to follow the "Add Custom Token" instructions which read...

**The steps to add custom token are as follows:**

1. On the “Add Token” page, click on “Add custom token” to expand the search window.
2. Enter token address of interest in the space under “Token Address”.
3. Click next to proceed
4. You will be directed to confirm adding token. Click “Add Token” to confirm.

Go to [AVIV Interact!](https://aviv-official.github.io/aviv-interact/index.html)

This first time you connect, you will be prompted by MetaMask if you want the page to connect to your wallet, go ahead and accept.

From here it is a matter of waiting, it can take up to 30 minutes to acquire your Estate depending on how congested the network is.  There is not much visual feedback, but ...
